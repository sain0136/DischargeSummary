# Discharge Summary Webform

This repository contains a **Discharge Summary Webform**, a custom-built form developed for the **Canadian Mental Health Association - Champlain East Branch** (CMHA). The webform was created using **HTML** and **JavaScript** to integrate seamlessly with a third-party software used by the organization. The form was designed to meet the specific requirements of the CMHA, allowing them to generate and manage discharge summaries through a user-friendly web interface.

## Project Overview

The **Discharge Summary Webform** serves as a customized solution for generating and handling discharge summaries. The form was built to:

- Ensure proper integration with CMHA's third-party software system.
- Automate and streamline the form-filling process.
- Provide a user-friendly interface for non-technical staff members to use.
- Maintain consistency in formatting and data collection for discharge summaries.
